# Snack Money API
**v1.0.0**

The **Snack Money API** enables seamless microtransaction and reward distribution for social networks and other platforms.  
It is designed for scenarios where you need to send small amounts of USDC to individual users or groups, validate payments, and automate content-based reward payouts.

---

## Features

- **Single Payments** – Send USDC payments directly to recipients via platform-specific endpoints.
- **Batch Payments** – Send USDC to multiple recipients in one request via batch payment endpoints.
- **Payment Validation** – Validate payment status and details using `/payments/validate`.
- **Reward Distribution** – Create and confirm reward distribution orders based on content engagement.
- **Supports Multiple Identities** – Payments can be made to recipients identified via:
  - Farcaster (`/payments/farcaster/pay`)
  - X/Twitter (`/payments/x/pay`)
  - Email (`/payments/email/pay`)
  - Domain names (`/payments/web/pay`)
- **X402-Compliant** – Payment-required responses include full X-PAYMENT header details for compliance.

---

## Authentication

Some endpoints require the `X-PAYMENT` header for processing.  
The header contains payment details that comply with the [X402 payment protocol](https://x402.org/).

---

## Error Handling

The API returns standardized error responses:
- **400** – Validation errors
- **402** – Payment required
- **500** – Internal server errors
